#### Case A: Multiple measurements per row

Necessary columns:

  + **cell_line** = name of the cell line used in the experiment
  + **treatment** = name of the treatment used in the experiment
  + **concentration** = concentration value (not log-transformed) of the treatment (all concentrations must be positive numbers)
  + **cell_count** = treated cell count (end of assay) - measure of cell number in the treated well at the end of the assay
  + **cell\_count\_\_ctrl** - control cell count (end of assay) - measure of cell number in the control well (e.g. untreated or DMSO-treated) from the same plate at the end of the assay
  + **cell\_count\_\_time0** - initial cell count (time of treatment) - measure of cell number at the beginning of the assay. (measure of cells in an untreated well grown in parallel until the time of treatment)

You may use a surrogate of cell number (such as CellTiter-GloÂ® staining) for the 'cell counts'.

You may include additional columns to be used for grouping the dose-response experiments.
